							<h1>JINX</h1>
							<h2>One of the main characters in Arcane</h2>
							<p>Jinx is a character in a show called "Arcane", and a playable character in the game "League of Legends". In said game she is considered a manic, a psycho with a love for blowing things up and shooting at opponets. However in the show we see the other side, a child with an unseen and unchecked mental disorder just trying to survive. We see Powder, a girl who lost her parents to soon, accidently killed her new family and lost her sister, the one person who she felt had the most care for her. This causes the spiral down to a place she may not return from; She becomes Jinx. </p>
